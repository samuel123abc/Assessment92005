    <h2>Introduction to the Causes</h2>
    <p>
      The decline of New Zealandâ€™s unique native species is a multifaceted issue. Several key factors have contributed to this tragic loss of biodiversity. Understanding these causes is crucial to driving effective conservation efforts.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Main Causes</h2>
    <p>The major causes behind the decline of native species include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Habitat Destruction:</strong> Urbanization, agriculture, and logging have severely reduced the habitat available to many species.</li>
      <li><strong>Introduced Predators:</strong> Animals like rats, stoats, and possums, which were introduced by humans, have devastated native bird populations.</li>
      <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Shifting weather patterns, rising sea levels, and changing ecosystems affect speciesâ€™ ability to adapt and survive.</li>
      <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Pesticides, plastic waste, and water contamination have long-term effects on ecosystems, impacting species' health.</li>
      <li><strong>Overhunting & Poaching:</strong> Some species were historically hunted to the brink of extinction, and poaching still threatens species today.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>In-Depth Look: Habitat Destruction</h2>
    <p>
      The destruction of natural habitats is one of the most immediate threats to New Zealandâ€™s native species. Urban expansion and agricultural practices have led to deforestation and the draining of wetlands. This has caused many species to lose their homes, reducing their chances of survival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Efforts to restore native forests and wetlands are crucial for creating safe spaces for wildlife to thrive.

    <h2>In-Depth Look: Introduced Predators</h2>
    <p>
      New Zealandâ€™s native species evolved in the absence of land mammals, making them particularly vulnerable to predators like rats, stoats, and weasels. These predators hunt native birds, eggs, and insects, pushing many species closer to extinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conservationists have undertaken massive efforts, including predator-proof fencing and intensive trapping programs, to mitigate the damage caused by these invaders.

    <h2>In-Depth Look: Climate Change</h2>
    <p>
      Climate change is altering the delicate ecosystems that support New Zealandâ€™s native species. Shifts in temperature, rainfall, and sea levels threaten the availability of food and habitat for many species.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impacts of climate change could be irreversible if action is not taken to mitigate its effects.
